# Snake Game in Python

This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to control the snake's movement and guide it to eat the food that appears on the screen. As the snake eats the food, it grows longer, and the player's score increases. The game ends if the snake collides with the boundary or with its own body.

## Installation

To run the Snake Game, you'll need Python and Pygame installed on your system. If you don't have Pygame, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Play

1. Run the `snake_game.py` script using Python.

2. The game window will open, displaying the snake and food.

3. Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys: up, down, left, and right.

4. Guide the snake to eat the food to grow longer and increase your score.

5. Avoid colliding with the boundary or the snake's own body, as it will end the game.

6. The game will automatically restart after the game over, so you can keep playing and try to beat your high score.
